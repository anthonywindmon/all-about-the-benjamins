The purpose of this repository is demonstrate the use of data sceince techniques for data cleaning and data visualizations. 

In the "scripts" folder, TechSalary_CleanUp.ipynb includes the data cleaning code and TechSalary_Visuals includes data visualizations from the cleaned dataset.

In the "datasets" folder, Tech_Salary_Transparency_Form_Responses.csv is the original (uncleaned) dataset and cleanSalaryData.csv is the new cleaned dataset.

In the "graphs" folder, each graph created for visualization is stored.

I plan to update the dataset with the new survey information very soon!
